# Mogan Editor / [墨干编辑器](README_ZH.md)
Mogan Editor is a structure editor delivered by the [Xmacs Labs](https://github.com/XmacsLabs), which is a fork of [GNU TeXmacs](https://www.texmacs.org).

GNU TeXmacs is a structured editor developed by [Joris van der Hoeven](http://www.texmacs.org/joris/main/joris.html), a mathematician at CNRS in France, since the late 1990s. It is designed to write high-quality technical documents using an intuitive and easy-to-use graphical interface, and can achieve the same level of results as LaTeX. Main users are currently primary and secondary school teachers (mostly in France) and university researchers.

[Darcy Shen](https://github.com/darcy-shen) released Mogan v1.0.0 on January 30, 2022, and created [XmacsLabs](https://gitee.com/XmacsLabs), a non-profit organization that aims to popularize GNU TeXmacs and make it available to all to enjoy the excellent software developed by Joris van der Hoeven.

## What is GNU TeXmacs
Highly recommended to watch the official demo of TeXmacs 2.1

- GNU TeXmacs is a free scientific editing platform designed to create beautiful technical documents using a wysiwyg interface.
- It provides a unified and user friendly framework for editing structured documents with different types of content: text, mathematics, graphics, interactive content, slides, etc.
- TeXmacs can be used as a graphical front-end for many systems in computer algebra, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.
- Documents can be saved in TeXmacs, Xml or Scheme format and printed as Pdf or Postscript files. Converters exist for TeX/LaTeX and Html/Mathml. Notice that TeXmacs is not based on TeX/LaTeX.
- Its rendering engine uses high-quality typesetting algorithms so as to produce professionally looking documents, which can either be printed out or presented from a laptop.
- New styles can be written by the user and new features can be added to the editor using the Scheme extension language.
- Runs on all major Unix platforms, MacOS, and Windows.

Mogan inherits all the above features from GNU TeXmacs (see [the homepage of GNU TeXmacs](https://www.texmacs.org)), so it can also be used as a efficient study tool for students, teachers, and researchers in science and technology, and suitable to create high-quality assignment documents, report slides, and LaTeX-level papers.

## Goal
**We create Mogan Editor for everyone to learn and create science and technology.**

## The Name "Mogan"
Darcy:
> Mogan is named after [Mount Mogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Mogan), a famous attraction in my hometown. 墨干(Mogan) literally means "dried ink". The word is derived from 莫干(Mogan) which is a combination of [莫(Mo) and 干(Gan)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gan_Jiang_and_Mo_Ye).

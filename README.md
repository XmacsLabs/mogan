# Mogan Editor / [墨干编辑器](README_ZH.md)
Mogan Editor is a structure editor delivered by the [Xmacs Labs](https://github.com/XmacsLabs).

Mogan Editor is a **libre software** forked from [GNU TeXmacs](http://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/home/welcome.en.html), the major differences are:
+ Switched from GNU Guile 1.8.x to S7 Scheme
+ Upgraded from Qt 4.8.x to Qt 5.15.x
+ Via `Help->Mogan`, massive online TeXmacs documents provided by [Xmacs Planet](https://github.com/XmacsLabs/planet) and [TMML wiki](https://github.com/XmacsLabs/tmmlwiki)

## Goal
**We create Mogan Editor for everyone to learn and create science and technology.**

## Priorities
### Contributors and Developers of Mogan Editor
> **No Contributors and Developers, no Mogan Editor!**

The happiness of people who maintain and improve the Mogan Editor should be the highest priority. It is a non-profit project, any of us should not get upset by the project itself.

### High School First
We would like to spend more time on bugs, features and plugins for high school education. For plugins, Maxima, Gnuplot and [Eukleides](http://www.eukleides.org/overview.html) are the most important which can be adopted in high school education.

### College, University and Research Institute
We expect that the users in college, university and research institute are potential contributors of Mogan Editor. We will select the most important feature requests by those users to implement.

## 名
Darcy:

> Mogan is named after Mount Mogan[^1], a famous attraction in my hometown. 墨干(Mogan) literally means "dried ink". The word is derived from 莫干(Mogan) which is a combination of 莫(Mo) and 干(Gan)[^2].

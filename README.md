# Mogan Editor / [墨干编辑器](README_ZH.md)
Mogan Editor is a structure editor delivered by the Xmacs Labs.

Mogan Editor is forked from GNU TeXmacs and a libre software.

We customize GNU TeXmacs for everyone to enjoy it fluently.

We develop new features for everyone to learn and create science and technology.

Mogan is named after Mount Mogan[^1], a famous attraction in my hometown. 墨干(Mogan) literally means "dried ink". The word is derived from 莫干(Mogan) which is a combination of 莫(Mo) and 干(Gan)[^2].

  You can print the current file using <menu|File|Print|Print buffer> or
  <menu|<icon|tm_print.svg>|Print buffer>. Before printing, it is possible to
  preview your document first, using <menu|File|Preview> or
  <menu|<icon|tm_print.svg>|Preview>. By default, <TeXmacs> assumes that you
  have a 600dpi printer for a4 paper. These default settings can be changed
  in <menu|File|Page setup> .

  You can also print to a postscript file using <menu|File|Print|Print buffer
  to file> (in which case the default printer settings are used for creating
  the output) or <menu|File|Export> (in which case the printer settings are
  ignored). The recommended format for printing to a file is <name|Pdf>.
  <TeXmacs> also supports the older <name|Postscript> format.

  When adequately configuring <TeXmacs>, the editor is guaranteed to be
  <em|wysiwyg>: the result after printing out is exactly what you see on your
  screen. In order to obtain full wysiwygness, you should in particular
  select <verbatim|paper> for <menu|Document|Page|Format|Page rendering> and
  <menu|Document|Page|Margins|Same screen margins as on paper>. You should
  also make sure that the characters on your screen use the same number of
  dots per inch as your printer. This rendering precision of the characters
  may be changed using <menu|File|Page setup|Printer dpi>. Currently, minor
  typesetting changes may occur when changing the dpi, which may globally
  affect the document through line and page breaking.

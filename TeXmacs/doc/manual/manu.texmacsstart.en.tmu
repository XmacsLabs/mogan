  <tmdoc-title|Getting started with <TeXmacs>>

  This short guide is designed to help you master some of the fundamental notions of <TeXmacs>.

  <section|Document structure>

  Please move the cursor inside this <strong|piece of bold text>. You will observe a cyan box that appears around it. On the status bar, at the bottom right of your window, you may also notice the word<nbsp>“strong”. These two things reveal part of the <em|structure> of your document. In this case, the bold text was produced using the <em|tag> (also called <em|markup element> or <em|environment>) <markup|strong> and the box indicates the scope of this<nbsp>tag.

  <TeXmacs> comes with hundreds of tags for different purposes. The <markup|strong> tag is used to highlight important pieces of text. Most tags refer to <em|intent> (like highlighting important text) rather than <em|layout> (like printing the characters in boldface). <TeXmacs> makes use of customizable style files in order to translate intent into layout. This allows you to easily switch to another presentation (<abbr|e.g.> italic instead of bold text) if you change your mind.

  Tags can be nested. Move the cursor just before the number 2 (for the square) in the formula below and observe that four boxes are displayed : three light grey boxes (one for the entire equation, one for the expression inside the parentheses, and one for the fraction), plus a cyan box for the superscript. The cyan box is always used for the <em|innermost> tag with respect to cursor position, and it is called the <em|focus>.

  <\equation>
    z=a*<around*|(|b+<frac|c<rsup|2>|d>|)>.
  </equation>

  <section|Navigation>

  Let us examine more closely the <em|status bar>, located at the very bottom of this window, below the editing region. When moving the cursor around in this document, you will notice that the right hand side of the status bar shows the character just before the cursor. Now move the cursor back in the above equation, right after the number 2 and inside the superscript (check that the cyan box is displayed around the number 2). As you see, the status bar lists all englobing environments in order, from the outermost to the innermost one. Experiment by moving the cursor around in the formula while keeping an eye on the status bar. You will soon get comfortable using the feedback from the colored boxes and from the status bar while navigating in documents.

  There is an invisible character in the formula after the <math|a> and before the parenthesis in the equation: can you position the cursor and read off what it is from the status bar? You are right, it is an invisible multiplication. In mathematical formulas, you should refrain yourself from using a space if what you really mean is a multiplication. Remember that <TeXmacs> expects you to write down what you mean, not how it should be displayed. Multiplications should be invisible in the printed version of your document, but you might find it convenient to show them when editing your document. This can be done using the menu <menu|Document|Informative flags|Detailed>.

  Again position your cursor inside the above equation, and try moving around using the arrow keys <key*|left> <key*|right> <key*|up> <key*|down>. For instance, can you move the cursor from before to <math|d> to after the <math|2> and then after the invisible multiplication? Quickly, the cursor movements will probably feel very natural. Remember that the boxes (and in particular the cyan one) indicate where the cursor is located in the document structure.

  As an exercise, here is a word that uses a different layout for each one of its characters:

  <\quotation>
    <strong|c><verbatim|r><name|a><move|z||-.2em><with|color|red|y>
  </quotation>

  Experiment adding characters to this word: observe how the exact cursor position determines in which environment a new character gets inserted. Can you insert a second strong letter ‘c’ and a<nbsp>second lowered letter ‘z’ with only two mouse clicks and two keystrokes?

  <section|Toolbars>

  The graphical user interface of <TeXmacs> is highly context sensitive. In particular, the menus and the toolbars depend on the cursor position. Roughly speaking, the three toolbars serve the following purposes:

  <paragraph|Main toolbar>The first toolbar contains context-independent icons for common operations on files (<icon|tm_new_x2.png>, <text-dots>, <icon|tm_cancel_x2.png>), common editing operations (<icon|tm_cut_x2.png>, <text-dots>, <icon|tm_redo_x2.png>) and browsing<nbsp>(<icon|tm_back_x2.png>, <text-dots>, <icon|tm_forward_x2.png>).

  <paragraph|Mode-dependent toolbar>The icons on the second toolbar only depend on the main editing mode (text, mathematics, graphics, etc.). Inside ordinary text, the toolbar is subdivided into the following four groups:

  <\itemize>
    <item>the icons <icon|tm_section_x2.png>, <text-dots>, <icon|tm_index_x2.png> are used for the insertion of “large environments” that structure your document, like sections, theorems, item lists, etc.

    <item>the icons <icon|tm_emphasize_x2.png>, <text-dots>, <icon|tm_color_x2.png> are for common textual markup (emphasis, verbatim, color).

    <item>the icons <icon|tm_traverse_x2.png>, <text-dots>, <icon|tm_tmdoc_annotate_x2.png> are specific to the <tmstyle|tmdoc> style used by this particular document (they provide acccess to some macros that are useful when writing <TeXmacs> documentation, and you can ignore them for the moment).

    <item>the icons <icon|tm_math_x2.png>, <text-dots>, <icon|tm_shell_x2.png> are for the insertion of special types of markup, such as equations, tables, images, hyperlinks, animations, or interactive sessions.
  </itemize>

  <paragraph|Focus toolbar>The icons on the third and smallest toolbar are extremely context sensitive. It offers functionalities that are directly connected to the current focus (i.e.<nbsp>the current innermost environment, which is indicated by the cyan box).

  Observe how the focus bar changes when the cursor is moved; try clicking on the <icon|tm_numbered_x2.png> icon when the focus is on the above bullet list (but not immediately after a bullet) and observe what happens. The same mechanism allows displayed formulas to be numbered: go ahead and try it with the ones in this document!

  <section|Mathematical formulas>

  It is now time to type your first formula, say

  <\equation*>
    <big|int><rsub|a><rsup|b>f<rprime|'><around*|(|x|)>*\<mathd\>x=f<around*|(|b|)>-f<around*|(|a|)>.
  </equation*>

  Here is how we did it (go ahead and try whether you can repreduce the example):

  <\itemize>
    <item>Click on the <icon|tm_math_x2.png> icon in the mode-dependent icon toolbar to insert a <em|displayed formula> (<abbr|i.e.> a<nbsp>large centered formula).

    <item>The integral sign can be found under the <icon|tm_bigop_x2.png> icon, available when the cursor is inside a<nbsp>formula. When hovering the mouse over the button with <math|<op|<big|int>>>, a help balloon allows you to discover the corresponding keyboard shortcut<nbsp><shortcut|(math-big-operator "int")>. If you know <LaTeX>, then you may also use the <LaTeX> command <key|\\ i n t> followed by <key|return>.

    <item>The subscripts and superscripts can be obtained using the <icon|tm_subsup_x2.png> icon in the toolbar, or using the keys <key|^> and <key|_>. Make sure you exit the subscript environment before creating a superscript, otherwise you will be creating a superscript inside the subscript: remember that the cyan box is here to help you figure out the exact cursor position.

    <item>The prime can be inserted directly from the corresponding key <key|'>.

    <item>Note that typing an opening parenthesis <key|(> automatically creates the matching parenthesis as well. To exit the parentheses, use the arrow <key|right> or <key|)>.

    <item>Before the subexpression <math|\<mathd\>x>, an invisible multiplication is required: simply use the <key|*> key. The status bar will confirm that the multiplication sign has been entered correctly.

    <item>The upright ‘<math|\<mathd\>>’ from differential calculus is obtained <em|via> the shortcut <key|d tab tab>. Here <key|tab> stands for the tab-key and you should press <key|d> without using the shift key.
  </itemize>

  <section|Mathematical symbols>

  <TeXmacs> uses two simple but powerful mechanisms for entering mathematical symbols:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Basic symbols can be <em|juxtaposed> to obtain more complex ones. For instance, typing <key|- \<gtr\>> (two successive keystrokes here) yields <math|\<rightarrow\>>. Can you guess how to insert a<nbsp>symbol <math|\<pm\>> before the<nbsp><math|b> in the formula below?

    <\equation*>
      a=b
    </equation*>

    Such sequences of keystrokes are designed to be intuitive and easy to remember. Guess how to change the formula above to <math|a\<leqslant\>\<pm\>b>, <math|a\<rightarrow\>\<pm\>b> or even <math|a\<rightrightarrows\>\<pm\>b>?

    <item><em|Variants> of a symbol can be obtained using the tab-key <key|tab>, as demonstrated by the differential ‘<math|\<mathd\>>’ earlier. When several variants are available, pressing <key|tab> repeatedly cycles through them. In the formula above, type <key|\<less\>> \ between <math|a> and <math|b>, and immediately after this press <key|tab> repeatedly (if you are not sure what a symbol represents, keep an eye on the status bar). This mechanism can be used in particular to obtain Greek letters: try replacing <math|g> and <math|b> by <math|\<gamma\>> and <math|\<beta\>>, respectively, in the expression of the Lorentz factor from special relativity,

    <\equation*>
      g=<frac|1|<sqrt|1-b<rsup|2>>>.
    </equation*>
  </itemize>

  The two mechanisms can be combined: can you guess how the mathematical symbol <math|\<Updownarrow\>> can be obtained? Hint: it is a variant of <math|\<Leftrightarrow\>>.

  Don't forget entering <em|math mode> before trying to insert mathematical symbols or markup. New formulas can be inserted using <icon|tm_math_x2.png> icon on the mode-dependent icon toolbar or using the keyboard shortcuts <key|$> (inline formula) or <shortcut|(make-equation*)> (displayed equation).

  <section|Compatibility with other formats><label|Compatibility with other formats>

  <TeXmacs> documents can be saved without loss of information in three formats: the native <TeXmacs> format (file extension .tm), Xml (.tmml) and as a Scheme expression (.stm). <TeXmacs> also provides bi-directional converters for <LaTeX>, <name|Html> and <name|MathML>.

  In addition to the above textual formats,<TeXmacs> documents can be exported in a wysiwyg (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) way to either Postscript or Pdf, which are used as the primary formats for printing documents. <TeXmacs> can also export document fragments to several vector or raster image formats.

  <TeXmacs> documents can be converted to other formats using the different items in the File\<rightarrow\>Export menu. Similarly, the File\<rightarrow\>Import menu contains all formats which can be imported into <TeXmacs>. Besides exporting or importing entire documents, it is also possible to copy and paste document fragments in various formats using Edit\<rightarrow\>Copy to and Edit\<rightarrow\>Paste from. The default formats for copy and pasting can be specified in Tools\<rightarrow\>Miscellaneous\<rightarrow\>Export selections as and Tools\<rightarrow\>Miscellaneous\<rightarrow\>Import selections as.

  <section|<TeXmacs> Tree><label|tree>

  All TeXmacs documents or document fragments can be thought of as trees. For instance, the tree

  withmodemathconcatx+y+frac12+sqrty+z\ 

  typically represents the formula

  x+y+1/2+sqrt(y+z) \ (1)

  Internal nodes of TeXmacs trees\ 

  Each of the internal nodes of a TeXmacs tree is a string symbol and each of the leafs is an ordinary string. A string symbol is different from a usual string only from the efficiency point of view: TeXmacs represents each symbol by a unique number, so that it is extremely fast to test weather two symbols are equal.

  Leafs of TeXmacs trees\ 

  Currently, all strings are represented using the universal TeXmacs encoding. This encoding coincides with the Cork font encoding for all characters except “\<less\>” and “\<gtr\>”. Character sequences starting with “\<less\>” and ending with “\<gtr\>” are interpreted as special extension characters. For example, \<less\>alpha\<gtr\> stands for the letter \<alpha\>. The semantics of characters in the universal TeXmacs encoding does not depend on the context (currently, cyrillic characters are an exception, but this should change soon). In other words, the universal TeXmacs encoding may be seen as an analogue of Unicode. In the future, we might actually switch to Unicode.

  The string leafs either contain ordinary text or special data. TeXmacs supports the following atomic data types:

  Boolean numbers. Either true or false.

  Integers. Sequences of digits which may be preceded by a minus sign.

  Floating point numbers. Specified using the usual scientific notation.

  Lengths. Floating point numbers followed by a length unit, like 29.7cm or 2fn.

  Serialization and preferred syntax for editing\ 

  When storing a document as a file on your hard disk or when copying a document fragment to the clipboard, TeXmacs trees have to be represented as strings. The conversion without loss of information of abstract TeXmacs trees into strings is called serialization and the inverse process parsing. TeXmacs provides three ways to serialize trees, which correspond to the standard TeXmacs format, the XML format and the Scheme format.

  However, it should be emphasized that the preferred syntax for modifying TeXmacs documents is the screen display inside the editor. If that seems surprising to you, consider that a syntax is a way to represent information in a form suitable to understanding and modification. The on-screen typeset representation of a document, together with its interactive behaviour, is a particularly concrete syntax. Moreover, in the Document\<rightarrow\>Source menu, you may find different ways to customize the way documents are viewed, such as different levels of informative flags and a “source tree” mode for editing style files.

  <section|The style-sheet language><label|style-language.en>

  In the section about <hlink|writing a simple style package|../manual/manu.styles.ch.tmu#sec-style-example> we already gave you a first impression about the style-sheet language of <TeXmacs>. In this section, we will give a more complete survey of the available features.

  The style-sheet primitives can be obtained from the <menu|Source> menu when you are in source mode. In all other modes, the <menu|Source> menu becomes visible after enabling the <menu|Source macros tool> in the <menu|Tools> menu. Alternatively, you may use the <prefix|A-> and <prefix|executable> keyboard prefixes in source mode and the<nbsp><prefix|inactive> and<nbsp><prefix|executable> prefixes otherwise. Furthermore, we recall that the hybrid <key|\\>-key may be used for creating macro-applications or arguments, depending on the context. Finally, the <shortcut|(structured-insert-right)> and <shortcut|(structured-insert-left)> keys are used for inserting arguments.

  <section|Page layout><label|Page layout>

  In this section, we describe how <TeXmacs> fills pages with typesetted content. Besides specifying the settings on how to print a document, the user may also determine the way pages should be rendered on screen. It should be noticed that the number of environment variables is redundant in the sense that some variables are computed as a function of other ones. For instance, by default, the paragraph width is computed as a function of the page size and the left and right margins.

  <paragraph*|Paper specific variables>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-type|a4><explain-synopsis|the size of pages>
  <|explain>
    Specify the size of a page when printing out. Most standard formats are available in <menu|Document|Page|Size>. By default, the paper size is the one of your printer (the default printer settings may be changed in <menu|Edit|Preferences|Printer>). When the <src-var|page-type> is set to <verbatim|user>, then the page size is given by <src-var|page-width> and <src-var|page-height>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-orientation|portrait><explain-synopsis|page orientation>
  <|explain>
    The orientation of pages can be either <verbatim|portrait> or <verbatim|landscape>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-nr|0><explain-synopsis|current page number>
  <|explain>
    The current page number. This environment variable should be manipulated with care, since it is not yet available at typesetting time. For a reliable determination of page numbers, one may combine the <markup|label> and <markup|page-ref> primitives. Nevertheless, the <src-var|page-nr> variable can be used in the macros which render page headers and footers.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <src-var|page-the-page><explain-synopsis|display the page number>
  <|explain>
    This environment variable really contains the macro which is used for rendering the page-number. By default, it renders <src-var|page-nr>. The macro takes no arguments. In order to simulate a document whose first page number is <math|123>, one may redefine

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<assign|page-the-page|<macro|<plus|<value|page-nr>|122>>>>
    </tm-fragment>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-breaking|optimal><explain-synopsis|page breaking algorithm>
  <|explain>
    This parameter specifies the page breaking algorithm. The default <verbatim|optimal> algorithm takes into account the global document and tries hard to avoid bad page breaks. The alternative <verbatim|sloppy> algorithm uses a fast first-fit algorithm, but produces bad page break with a higher probability. The <verbatim|medium> quality algorithm is the same as the <verbatim|optimal> algorithm, except for two column content.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-flexibility|1.0><explain-synopsis|flexibility for stretching>
  <|explain>
    This parameter specifies how much stretchable spaces may be extended or reduced in order to fill pages which are too short or too long. A page flexibility of <math|1> allows spaces to be stretched to their minimal and maximal values. A page flexibility of <math|0> prevents spaces to be stretched. For other values of <src-var|page-flexibility> the behaviour is linear.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-shrink|1fn><explain-synopsis|allowed amount of page shrinking>
  <|explain>
    In the case when it is very hard to find good page breaks, this parameter specifies an additional amount of space by which a page is allowed to be reduced.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-extend|0fn><explain-synopsis|allowed amount of page extensions>
  <|explain>
    In the case when it is very hard to find good page breaks, this parameter specifies an additional amount of space by which a page is allowed to be extended.
  </explain>

  <paragraph*|Screen specific variables>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-medium|papyrus><explain-synopsis|the page medium>
  <|explain>
    This environment variable, which is initialized using <menu|Document|Page|Type>, specifies how pages are rendered on the screen. The following values are available:

    <\description>
      <item*|<verbatim|paper>>Page breaks are visually indicated on the screen. This mode is useful for ajusting the final version of a document before printing or sending it to a publisher. However, the use of this mode slows down the editor since every modification in the document triggers the page-breaking algorithm.

      Notice also that the mere selection of this mode does not imply the screen margins and page decorations to be as on paper. In order to previsualize a document in a fully realistic way, you should also set <menu|Document|Page|Screen margins|Show header and footer> and <menu|Document|Page|Screen margins|Margins as on paper>.

      <item*|<verbatim|papyrus>>The paragraph width is the same as on paper, but page breaking is disabled. This mode is most useful during the editing phase of a document which will ultimately be printed out. It combines a reasonable editing speed with realistic line breaks.

      <item*|<verbatim|automatic>>The paragraph width is as large as possible so as to fit into the current window and page breaking is disabled. This setting, which makes optimal use of the available space on your screen, is useful for documents which are not intended to be printed out. It may for instance be selected when using <TeXmacs> as a browser or as an interface to computer algebra systems.
    </description>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-screen-width|10cm><explain-synopsis|width of the rendering window>
  <|explain>
    In <verbatim|automatic> mode, this environement variable contains the width of the screen.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-screen-height|10cm><explain-synopsis|height of the rendering window>
  <|explain>
    In <verbatim|automatic> mode, this environement variable contains the height of the screen.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-screen-margin|true><explain-synopsis|special margins for screen editing?>
  <|explain>
    This flag specifies whether the screen margins are manually specified by the user, or whether they are the same as on paper.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-screen-left|5mm>

    <var-val|page-screen-right|5mm>

    <var-val|page-screen-top|15mm>

    <var-val|page-screen-bot|15mm><explain-synopsis|left margin on screen>
  <|explain>
    When <src-var|page-screen-margin> is <verbatim|true>, then these environment variables determine the margins which are to be used for rendering on the screen.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-show-hf|false><explain-synopsis|show headers and footers on screen?>
  <|explain>
    This flag determines whether the page headers and footers should be visible on the screen. When set to <verbatim|true>, it should be noticed that the headers and footers are not always correctly updated when editing. In the case when you suspect them to be wrong, refreshing the display by scrolling down and up should display the correct values.
  </explain>

  <paragraph*|Specifying the margins>

  The parameters for page margins are represented schematically at the left hand side in figure <no-break><reference|tm-page-fig>. One may either specify the paragraph width as a function of the left and right margins, or <em|vice versa>. The left and right margins may depend on whether the page number is odd or even.

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-width-margin|false>

    <var-val|page-height-margin|false><explain-synopsis|compute margins from main text dimensions?>
  <|explain>
    When <src-var|page-width-margin> is set to <verbatim|false>, then the paragraph width <src-var|par-width> is determined automatically from the page size and the left and right margins. When set to <verbatim|true>, the left and right margins are determined as a function of the page size, the paragraph width, <src-var|page-odd-shift> and <src-var|page-even-shift>. For compatability with <TeX>/<LaTeX>, it is also possible to set <src-var|page-width-margin> to <verbatim|tex>, in which case the horizontal margins are determined from <src-var|page-odd>, <src-var|page-even> and <src-var|par-width>. The <src-var|page-height-margin> variable plays a similar role for the vertical margins.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-width|auto>

    <var-val|page-height|auto><explain-synopsis|page width>
  <|explain>
    By default, the width and height of a page are automatically determined from the page type. When <src-var|page-type> is set to <verbatim|user>, then the user may manually specify the page size using <src-var|page-width> and <src-var|page-height>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-odd|auto>

    <var-val|page-even|auto><explain-synopsis|left margin>
  <|explain>
    If <src-var|page-width-margin> is set to <verbatim|false>, then <src-var|page-odd> and <src-var|page-even> specify the left margins for odd and even pages. If <src-var|page-width-margin> is <verbatim|true>, then these values are computed as a function of the page size, the paragraph width, <src-var|page-odd-shift> and <src-var|page-even-shift>. When <src-var|page-odd> and <src-var|page-even> are set to <verbatim|auto>, then a nice default left margin is determined as a function of the specified page type.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-right|auto><explain-synopsis|right margin>
  <|explain>
    If <src-var|page-width-margin> is set to <verbatim|false>, then <src-var|page-right> specifies the right margin for odd pages. The right margin for even pages is given by the formula

    <\equation*>
      <text|<src-var|page-right>>+<text|<src-var|page-even>>-<text|<src-var|page-odd>>
    </equation*>

    If <src-var|page-width-margin> is <verbatim|true> or when <src-var|page-right> is set to <verbatim|auto>, then the right margin is determined in a similar way as the left margin.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|page-odd-shift|0mm>

    <var-val|page-even-shift|0mm><explain-synopsis|margin shifts>
  <|explain>
    If <src-var|page-width-margin> is set to <verbatim|true>, then the left margins for odd and even pages are determined from the page size, paragraph width and the margin shifts using the formulas

    <\eqnarray*>
      <tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<text|<src-var|page-even>>>|<cell|=>|<cell|<frac|<text|<src-var|page-width>>-<text|<src-var|par-width>>|2>+<text|<src-var|page-odd-shift>>>>|<row|<cell|<text|<src-var|page-odd>>>|<cell|=>|<cell|<frac|<text|<src-var|page-width>>-<text|<src-var|par-width>>|2>+<text|<src-var|page-even-shift>>>>>>
    </eqnarray*>

    The right margin is always taken to be such that the paragraph width and the left and right margins sum up to the page width.

    When using the justified alignment mode, it sometimes occurs that certain lines need to be stretched a lot, thereby leaving abnormally large spaces in the middle of those lines. This is typically the case inside bibliographies with unbreakable hyperlinks. The <src-var|par-flexibility> variable specifies a threshold above which justification of a line is abandoned. More precisely, we switch to left alignment whenever the remaining space on a line exceeds <src-var|par-flexibility> times the maximal amount of stretching which still ‘‘looks nice'' for the given font.

  <\explain>
    <var-val|par-sep|0.2fn><explain-synopsis|extra separation between successive lines>
  <|explain>
    The sum of the font size and <inactive|<value|par-sep>> determines the ideal distance between two successive base lines in a paragraph (also called the ‘‘base line skip''). Of course, when the lines contain large boxes, then this distance may need to be increased. When <verbatim|1fn> for <inactive|<value|par-sep>>, one may for instance produce documents with a double interline space:

    <\tm-fragment>
      <\with|par-sep|1fn>
        A double interline space corresponds to <var-val|par-sep|1fn>. Double interline spaces are often used by lazy people who want to pretend that they have written many pages. They generally do not care about tropical rain forests.
      </with>
    </tm-fragment>

    In the case when two successive lines use different base line skips, then the maximal value is used in order to compute the ideal distance between their baselines. This allows for a reasonable spacing when the font size is changed from one paragraph to another:

    <\tm-fragment>
      <\with|par-par-sep|0fn>
        Normal text.

        <very-large|Some very large text.>

        And back to normal.

  <\explain>
    <var-val|par-line-sep|0.025fn*><explain-synopsis|extra space between lines>
  <|explain>
    This parameter corresponds an additional stretchable amount of whitespace between successive lines in a paragraph. Setting <inactive|<value|par-line-sep>> to a small stretchable value which defaults to <math|0> allows the page breaker to correctly stretch pages which contain a very long textual paragraph. Indeed, <inactive|<value|par-line-sep>> vanishes, then the height of a textual paragraph is of the form <math|a+b*n>, where <math|a> and <math|b> are constants and <math|n> is the number of lines. There is no reason why the usable height of a page should be of this form.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|par-par-sep|0.5fn*><explain-synopsis|extra space between paragraphs>
  <|explain>
    The <src-var|par-par-sep> parameter specifies the amount of vertical whitespace which separates two successive paragraphs. This space is determined in stretchable length units. By default, <TeXmacs> does not use any whitespace between successive paragraphs, except when no nice page breaks could be found (this explains the use of the <verbatim|fn*> length unit). Starts of new paragraphs are rather indicated through the use of first indentations (see table <reference|par-first-tab>).

    In the case when two successive paragraph use different paragraph separations, then the maximum of the two is taken. In fact, the <src-var|par-par-sep> length is added to both the vertical spacing before and the vertical spacing after the paragraph.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|par-hor-sep|0.5fn>

    <var-val|par-ver-sep|0.2fn><explain-synopsis|minimal space between ink>
  <|explain>
    When a paragraph contains several exceptionally large boxes, then <TeXmacs> attempts to ‘‘shove successive lines into another'' as long as none of the boxes collide:

    <\with|font-base-size|10>
      <\tm-fragment>
        Consider a fraction which decends more than usual like <math|<frac|1|x+1>> at the end of a line and an expression like <math|\<mathe\><rsup|\<mathe\><rsup|x>>> which is higher than usual.

        When these expressions occur at different places, then <TeXmacs> tries to render the successive lines in a compact manner.

        In the case of a fraction <math|<frac|1|x+1>> and an exceptionally high expression at the wrong place, like the expression <math|\<mathe\><rsup|\<mathe\><rsup|x>>> here, the boxes are separated by <src-var|env-ver-sep>.
      </tm-fragment>
    </with>

    As soon as the horizontal distance between two large boxes is less than <src-var|par-hor-sep>, then they are considered to be in collision. In that case, the vertical distance between them must be at least <src-var|par-ver-sep>. Also, the amount of showing never exceeds <verbatim|1ex>.

    When using an interline space of <verbatim|1.5> or <verbatim|2>, the default value of <src-var|par-ver-sep> allows the user to type larger formulas in the text while preserving a uniform layout. When using a small <src-var|par-sep> and a large <inactive|<value|par-ver-sep>>, the distance between two successive lines remains small, except when their contents are horizontally close. This may for instance be used to reduce the space between a short like followed by a centered equation.

  <section|<TeXmacs> lengths>

  A simple <TeXmacs> length is a number followed by a length unit, like <verbatim|1cm> or <verbatim|1.5mm>. <TeXmacs> supports three main types of units:

  <\description>
    <item*|Absolute units>The length of an absolute unit like <verbatim|cm> or <verbatim|pt> on print is fixed.

    <item*|Context dependent units>Context-dependent length units depend on the current font or other environment variables. For instance, <verbatim|1ex> corresponds to the height of the “x” character in the current font and <verbatim|1par> correspond to the current paragraph width.

    <item*|User defined units>Any nullary macro, whose name contains only lower case roman letters followed by <verbatim|-length>, and which returns a length, can be used as a unit itself. For instance, the following macro defines the <verbatim|dm> length:

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<assign|dm-length|<macro|10cm>>>
    </tm-fragment>
  </description>

  Furthermore, length units can be <em|stretchable>. A stretchable length is represented by a triple of rigid lengths: a minimal length, a default length and a maximal length. When justifying lines or pages, stretchable lengths are automatically sized so as to produce nicely looking layout.

  In the case of page breaking, the <src-var|page-flexibility> environment provides additional control over the stretchability of white space. When setting the <src-var|page-flexibility> to <math|1>, stretchable spaces behave as usual. When setting the <src-var|page-flexibility> to <math|0>, stretchable spaces become rigid. For other values, the behaviour is linear.

  <paragraph*|Absolute length units>

  <\description>
    <item*|<code*|cm>>One centimeter.

    <item*|<code*|mm>>One millimeter.

    <item*|<code*|in>>One inch.

    <item*|<code*|pt>>The standard typographic point corresponds to <math|1/72.27> of an inch.

    <item*|<verbatim|bp>>A big point corresponds to <math|1/72> of an inch.

    <item*|<verbatim|dd>>The Didôt point equals 1/72 of a French inch, <abbr|i.e.> <verbatim|0.376mm>.

    <item*|<verbatim|pc>>One “pica” equals 12 points.

    <item*|<verbatim|cc>>One “cicero” equals 12 Didôt points.
  </description>

  <paragraph*|Rigid font-dependent length units>

  <\description>
    <item*|<verbatim|fs>>The font size. When using a <verbatim|12pt> font, <verbatim|1fs> corresponds to <verbatim|12pt>.

    <item*|<verbatim|fbs>>The base font size. Typically, when selecting <verbatim|10> as the font size for your document and when typing large text, the base font size is <verbatim|10pt> and the font size <verbatim|12pt>.

    <item*|<code*|ln>>The width of a nicely looking fraction bar for the current font.

    <item*|<code*|sep>>A typical separation between text and graphics for the current font, so as to keep the text readable. For instance, the numerator in a fraction is shifted up by <verbatim|1sep>.

    <item*|<verbatim|yfrac>>The height of the fraction bar for the current font (approximately <verbatim|0.5ex>).

    <item*|<verbatim|ex>>The height of the “x” character in the current font.

    <item*|<verbatim|emunit>>The width of the “M” character in the current font.
  </description>

  <paragraph*|Stretchable font-dependent length units>

  <\description>
    <item*|<code*|fn>>This is a stretchable variant of <verbatim|1quad>. The default length of <verbatim|1fn> is <verbatim|1quad>. When stretched, <verbatim|1fn> may be reduced to <verbatim|0.5fn> and extended to <verbatim|1.5fn>.

    <item*|<verbatim|fns>>This length defaults to zero, but it may be stretched up till <verbatim|1fn>.

    <item*|<verbatim|bls>>The “base line skip” is the sum of <verbatim|1quad> and <src-var|par-sep>. It corresponds to the distance between successive lines of normal text.

    Typically, the baselines of successive lines are separated by a distance of <verbatim|1fn> (in <TeXmacs> and <LaTeX> a slightly larger space is used though so as to allow for subscripts and superscripts and avoid a too densely looking text. When stretched, <verbatim|1fn> may be reduced to <verbatim|0.5fn> and extended to <verbatim|1.5fn>.

    <item*|<code*|spc>>The (stretchable) width of space character in the current font.

    <item*|<verbatim|xspc>>The additional (stretchable) width of a space character after a period.
  </description>

  <paragraph*|Box lengths><label|box-lengths>

  Box length units can only be used within some special markup elements, such as <markup|move>, <markup|shift>, <markup|resize>, <markup|clipped> and <markup|image>. The principal body of this content (<abbr|e.g.> the content being “moved” in the case of <markup|move>) is typeset as a box. The following lengths units then correspond to the size and the extents of the box.

  <\description>
    <item*|<code*|w>>The width of the box.

    <item*|<verbatim|h>>The height of the box.

    <item*|<code*|l>>The logical left <math|x>-coordinate of the box.

    <item*|<code*|r>>The logical right <math|x>-coordinate of the box.

    <item*|<code*|b>>The logical bottom <math|y>-coordinate of the box.

    <item*|<code*|t>>The logical top <math|y>-coordinate of the box.
  </description>

  For instance, the code

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<move|Hello there||<plus|-0.5b|-0.5t>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  can be used to center <move|Hello there||<plus|-0.5b|-0.5t>> at the base-line.

  <paragraph*|Other length units>

  <\description>
    <item*|<code*|par>>The width of the paragraph. That is the length the text can span. It is affected by paper size, margins, number of columns, column separation, cell width (if in a table), <abbr|etc.>

    <item*|<verbatim|pag>>The height of the main text in a page. In a similar way as <verbatim|par>, this length unit is affected by page size, margins, <abbr|etc.>

    <item*|<code*|px>>One screen pixel, the meaning of this unit is affected by the shrinking factor.

    <item*|<code*|tmpt>>The smallest length unit for internal length calculations by <TeXmacs>. <verbatim|1px> divided by the shrinking factor corresponds to <verbatim|256tmpt>.
  </description>

  <paragraph*|Different ways to specify lengths>

  There are three types of lengths in <TeXmacs>:

  <\description>
    <item*|Simple lengths>A string consisting of a number followed by a length unit.

    <item*|Abstract lengths>An abstract length is a macro which evaluates to a length. Such lengths have the advantage that they may depend on the context.

    <item*|Normalized lengths>All lengths are ultimately converted into a normalized length, which is a tag of the form <explain-macro|tmlen|l> (for rigid lengths) or <explain-macro|tmlen|min|def|max> (for stretchable lengths). The user may also use this tag in order to specify stretchable lengths. For instance, <inactive*|<tmlen|<minus|1quad|1pt>|1quad|1.5quad>> evaluates to a length which is <verbatim|1quad> by default, at least <verbatim|1quad-1pt> and at most <verbatim|1.5quad>.
  </description>

  <section|Defining new environments><label|Defining new environments>

  The <tmdtd|env-base> <abbr|d.t.d.> contains high-level markup which can be used by the user to define new numbered environments for theorems, remarks, exercises and figures:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|new-theorem|env-name|display-name>>
    This meta-macro is used for defining new theorem-like environments. The first argument <src-arg|env-name> specifies the name for the environment (like ‘‘experiment'') and <src-arg|display-name> the corresponding text (like ‘‘Experiment''). When defining a new theorem-like environment like <markup|experiment>, an unnumbered variant <markup|experiment*> is automatically defined as well.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|new-remark|env-name|display-name>>
    Similar as <markup|new-theorem>, but for remarks.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|new-exercise|env-name|display-name>>
    Similar as <markup|new-theorem>, but for exercises.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|new-figure|env-name|display-name>>
    Similar as <markup|new-theorem>, but for figures. When defining a new type of figure, like ‘‘picture'', the <markup|new-figure> macro defines both the inline environment <markup|small-picture> and the block-environment <markup|big-picture>, as well as the unnumbered variants <markup|small-picture*> and <markup|big-picture*>.
  </explain>

  The theorem-like and remark-like environments belong to a common counter-group <verbatim|theorem-env>. By default, we use American-style numbering (one common counter for all environments). When selecting the package <tmpackage|number-europe>, each environment uses its own counter. All exercises and figures use their own counter-group.

  More generally, the <verbatim|std-env> counter-group regroups the counters for all standard <TeXmacs> environments. Typically, all counters in this group are prefixed in a similar way (for instance by the number of the chapter). Figure <reference|std-env-fig> shows how the hierarchical organization of this counter group.

  <\big-figure|<tree|<verbatim|std-env>|<tree|<verbatim|theorem-env>|<tabular*|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<verbatim|theorem>>>|<row|<cell|<verbatim|proposition>>>|<row|<cell|<verbatim|remark>>>|<row|<cell|<math|\<vdots\>>>>>>>>|<tree|<verbatim|exercise-env>|<tabular*|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<verbatim|exercise>>>|<row|<cell|<verbatim|problem>>>>>>>|<tree|<verbatim|figure-env>|<tabular*|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<verbatim|figure>>>|<row|<cell|<verbatim|table>>>>>>>|<verbatim|equation>|<verbatim|footnote>>>
    <label|std-env-fig>Organization of the counters for the standard <TeXmacs> environments.
  </big-figure>

  In addition to the standard theorem-like, remark-like, exercise-like and figure-like environments, other numbered textual environments may be defined using the <markup|new-env> macro. These environments may be based on arbitrary counter-groups:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|new-env|env-name|display-name|group|render>>
    The first argument <src-arg|env-name> specifies the name for the environment (like ‘‘experiment'') and the second, <src-arg|display-name>, the corresponding text (like ‘‘Experiment''). The third argument is the name of the counter <src-arg|group> to which the new environment belongs. The last argument <src-arg|render> is the name of a binary macro for rendering the environment. The arguments of the rendering macro are a name (like ‘‘Theorem 3.14'') and its body. You may use this macro to define new environments based on counter-groups other than the standard five <verbatim|theorem-env>, <verbatim|exercise-env>, etc. For instance, in the standard style-sheets, <markup|new-theorem> is defined by

    <\tm-fragment>
      <\inactive*>
        <assign|new-theorem|<macro|env|name|<new-env|<arg|env>|<arg|name>|theorem-env|render-theorem>>>
      </inactive*>
    </tm-fragment>
  </explain>

  We recall that you may add new counters or counter-groups to the <verbatim|theorem-env> counter-group using the <markup|new-counter-group> and <markup|add-to-counter-group> macros, as described in the section about counters.

  \;

  <section|Counters and counter groups><label|Counters and counter groups>

  In <TeXmacs>, all automatic numbering of theorems, sections, <abbr|etc.> is done using “counters”. Such counters may be individual counters (like <src-var|equation-nr>) or belong to a group of similar counters (like in the case of <src-var|theorem-nr>). <TeXmacs> allows for the customization of counters on an individual or groupwise basis. Typically, you may redefine the rendering of a counter (and let it appear as roman numerals, for instance), or undertake special action when increasing the counter (such as resetting a subcounter).

  New individual counters are defined using the following meta-macro:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|new-counter|x>>
    Defines a new counter with name <src-arg|x>. The counter is stored in the numerical environment variable <no-break><src-var|x-nr> and in addition, the following macros are defined:

    <\explain|<explain-macro|the-<em|x>>>
      Retrieve the counter such as it should be displayed on the screen.
    </explain>

    <\explain|<explain-macro|reset-<em|x>>>
      Reset the counter to <math|0>.
    </explain>

    <\explain|<explain-macro|inc-<em|x>>>
      Increase the counter. This macro may also be customized by the user so as to reset other counters (even though this is not the way things are done in the standard style files).
    </explain>

    <\explain|<explain-macro|next-<em|x>>>
      Increase the counter, display the counter and set the current label.
    </explain>

    For the purpose of customization, the <markup|new-counter> macro also defines the following macros:

    <\explain|<explain-macro|display-<em|x>|nr>>
      This is the macro which is used for transforming the numerical value of the counter into the value which is displayed on the screen.
    </explain>

    <\explain|<explain-macro|counter-<em|x>|x>>
      This internal macro is used in order to retrieve the name of the environment variable which contains the counter. By default, this macro returns ‘‘nr-x'', but it may be redefined if the counter belongs to a group.

  As noticed in the introduction, <TeXmacs> uses <em|counter groups> in order to make it possible to treat similar counters in a uniform way. For instance the counter group <verbatim|theorem-env> regroups the counters <verbatim|theorem>, <verbatim|proposition>, <verbatim|lemma>, <abbr|etc.> New counter groups are defined using:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|new-counter-group|g>>
    Create a new counter group with name <src-arg|g>. This results in the creation of the following macros:

    <\explain>
      <explain-macro|display-in-<em|g>|x|nr>

      <explain-macro|counter-in-<em|g>|x>
    <|explain>
      These macros are similar to the macros <markup|display-<em|x>> and <markup|counter-<em|x>> from above, but relative to the counter group. The name <src-arg|x> of the counter in consideration is passed as an argument.
    </explain>
  </explain>

  New counters can be added to the group using:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|add-to-counter-group|x|g>>
    Defines a new counter <src-arg|x> and add it to the counter group <src-arg|g>. For counters in groups, the macros <markup|display-<em|x>> and <markup|counter-<em|x>> are replaced with the corresponding macros <markup|display-in-<em|g>> and <markup|counter-<no-break>in-<no-break><em|g>> for their groups. Nevertheless, two new macros <markup|ind-display-<em|x>> and <markup|ind-counter-<em|x>> are defined which may take over the roles of <markup|display-<em|x>> and <markup|counter-<em|x>> in the case when the group consists of individual counters.
  </explain>

  At any moment, you may decide whether the counters of a group share a common group counter, or whether they all use their individual counters. This feature is used for instance in order to switch between American style numbering and European style numbering:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|group-common-counter|g>>
    Use a common counter for the group (which is stored in the environment variable <src-var|g-nr>).
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|group-individual-counters|g>>
    Use an individual counter for each member of the group (this is the default).
  </explain>

  We notice that group counters may recursively belong to super-groups. For instance, the following declarations are from <verbatim|env-base.ts>:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\inactive*>
      <new-counter-group|std-env>
    </inactive*>

    <inactive*|<new-counter-group|theorem-env>>

    <inactive*|<add-to-counter-group|theorem-env|std-env>>

    <inactive*|<group-common-counter|theorem-env>>
  </tm-fragment>

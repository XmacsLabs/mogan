  <tmdoc-title|ChangeLog of Mogan Editor v1.0.2>

  The most significant change of Mogan Editor v1.0.2 is that we've separated
  the <menu|Help|Mogan> doc and migrated it to two remote <TeXmacs>
  documents. And the release manager of Mogan Editor v1.0.2 is too lazy to
  prepare the ChangeLog for Mogan Editor v1.0.2.

  Here are the two remote <TeXmacs> documents.

  It is 2022/04/05 now. And Youth Day is a holiday celebrated annually on May
  4 in the People's Republic of China.

  May the force be with YOU!

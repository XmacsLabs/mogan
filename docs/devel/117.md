# nowide
## Main Changes
+ Remove the source code inclusion of nowide
+ Upgrade nowide (the newest copyright is 2015) to nowide_standalone 11.2.0 provided by xmake and xrepo

## Darcy's reason on why we only use nowide for Windows
1. nowide is not the dependency of the macOS and the GNU Linux distribution of Mogan 1.1.1
2. For GNU/Linux, we prefer to depend on the library available in the official software center (eg. Debian Repository).

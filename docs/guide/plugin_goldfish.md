# Goldfish Scheme Session Plugin

Goldfish Scheme is a Scheme interpreter based on S7 Scheme. It mainly includes the following customizations on the basis of S7 Scheme:
1. Implementation of the standard libraries defined in R7RS.
2. Implementation of several commonly used SRFIs.
3. Provision of several commonly used function libraries, such as HTTP clients, Markdown parsers.

The Goldfish Scheme included in the Mogan Technology Suite is the community version of Goldfish Scheme, whose main function is to provide a Scheme interpreter for the MathAgape community version.

Beginners of the Scheme language can learn the Scheme language using Goldfish Scheme in Mogan.

## Installation
No installation is required, as both Goldfish Scheme and the Goldfish Scheme plugin are built-in within Mogan.

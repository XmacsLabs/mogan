# docx Data Plugin
## TeXmacs -> docx
The option to export to docx can be found in `Edit -> Preferences -> Converters -> docx`.

### Prerequisite: `Pandoc`
The process of converting a TeXmacs document to a docx document relies on the third-party application `Pandoc`. If `Pandoc` is not available in the environment during export, an error will occur, and the export will fail.

For information on installing the `Pandoc` plugin, please refer to [Pandoc Binary Plugin](./plugin_binary_pandoc.md).

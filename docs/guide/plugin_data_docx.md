# docx Data Plugin
## TeXmacs -> docx
Export method: The option to export to docx is in `File->Export->docx`.

### Prerequisite: `pandoc`
The process of converting a TeXmacs document to a docx document relies on the third-party application `pandoc`. If `pandoc` is not available in the environment during export, an error will occur, and the export will fail.

For information on installing the `pandoc` plugin, please refer to [Pandoc Binary Plugin](./plugin_binary_pandoc.md).

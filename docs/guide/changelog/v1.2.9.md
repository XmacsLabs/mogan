> Notice: Mogan V1.2.9 officially sets TMU v1.0.3 as the default format. Mogan V1.2.9.3 is upgraded to TMU v1.0.4, which only involves the renaming of some dependent C++ routines, and is compatible with TMU v1.0.3. Mogan V1.2.9.5 is upgraded to TMU v1.0.5, which improves the conversion from UTF-8 encoding to Herk encoding and fixes issues with reading TMU format; additionally, it corrects the conversion of five uncommon Cork characters (Cork+17, Cork+18, Cork+1A, Cork+DF, Cork+7F) and UTF-8 according to the Cork encoding table on Wikipedia. TMU v1.0.5 is only incompatible with TMU v1.0.3 and v1.0.4 in these five uncommon Cork characters.

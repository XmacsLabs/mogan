## How to Install Python 3
### Windows
Go to the [Python official website](https://www.python.org) to download the installation package and install it.

If the user has not installed Python in the default path, they will need to manually add the directory where `python3.exe` is located to the PATH.

### macOS/Linux
Python is preinstalled on these systems, so no installation is required.

## How to Customize the Python Interpreter
You can use a custom Python interpreter by customizing the Python 3 binary plugin.

For detailed instructions on how to customize the Python3 binary plugin, please refer to the documentation: [Binary Plugins](plugin_binary.md). Detailed steps are available in the built-in documentation of Mogan under `Help -> Plugins -> Binary`.

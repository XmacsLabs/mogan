## How to install Ghostscript
### Windows
Go to the [Ghostscript official website](https://www.ghostscript.com) to download the installation package and install it to the system C drive according to the default path.

If users didn't install according to the default path, they need to manually add the directory where `gs.exe` is located to the PATH.

### macOS
Use `brew install ghostscript` to install.

### Linux
Use `sudo apt install ghostscript` or other ways to install.

  <tmdoc-title|Unit Tests for OSPP Students in 2023>

  For analyze_test and tree_test, there are existing unit tests. Here are the
  command line to build and test:

  <\shell-code>
    bin/test_only tree_test

    bin/test_only analyze_test
  </shell-code>

  <cpp|tree> and <cpp|rectangle> are two important C++ class for the Mogan
  Draw OSPP project. The functions in <shell|analyze.cpp> are widely used for
  string manipulation.

  <tmdoc-title|Mogan Draw <code|optimization> (OSPP)>

  This is a project about the drawing function of the Mogan Editor. It is
  also a project for the OpenSource Summer of Code. The duration for this
  OSPP is from July to September in 2023.

  \;

  <section|Goal>

  The main goal of this project is to improve the built-in tools for making
  technical graphics to be friendly enough for most users. User-friendliness
  includes many aspects, such as rich drawing tools, easy-to-open WASM web
  application (easier to use than local applications), reasonable UI
  interface, less bugs, comfortable interaction methods, etc. The focus of
  this project is to improve the user experience.

  <\quotation>
    Imagine that you are a teacher in a junior high school teaching Euclid's
    Elements, and you are using Mogan Editor/GNU <TeXmacs> to prepare the
    slides. You should be able to re-draw the figures in Euclid's Element via
    Mogan Draw in an easy way (straight-forward and no need to remember any
    tricks) and can persuade your colleagues to use Mogan Draw.
  </quotation>

  For example, in the above scenario, we hope that the improved mogan draw
  can meet the needs of middle school teachers and be easy to use.

  <section|Why>

  Due to the fact that Mogan Editor targets a user base that includes primary
  and secondary school teachers, and drawing functions are commonly used by
  them, we need to optimize the product to improve user experience.\

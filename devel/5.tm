  <tmdoc-title|Documentation in Markdown format for users and developers>

  Documentation in markdown format can be viewed on Codeberg/Gitee/Github
  directly and will also be rendered on <slink|https://mogan.app>.

  For new users, those docs should be concise and straightforward. For
  developers, those docs should help them get involved in an easy way.

  The handy scripts for developers in the <shell|bin> directory should also
  be created in this project.

Description:  A structured editor for science and technology
	     Mogan Editor is a fork of GNU TeXmacs using S7 Scheme and Qt 5 with massive
	     online TeXmacs documents provided by Xmacs Planet and TMML wiki.
	     The software includes a text editor with support for mathematical formulas,
	     a small technical picture editor and a tool for making presentations from
	     a laptop. Moreover, Mogan can be used as an interface for many external
	     systems for computer algebra, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.
	     New presentation styles can be written by the user and new features can be
	     added to the editor using the Scheme extension language. A native spreadsheet
	     and tools for collaborative authoring are planned for later.
	     Mogan runs on all major Unix platforms and Windows. Documents can be
	     saved in TeXmacs, Xml or Scheme format and printed as Postscript or
	     Pdf files. Converters exist for TeX/LaTeX and Html/Mathml.
